***The main purpose of the analysis of data was to correct the data. Because in this dataset, all classes are imbalanced and it make models bias toward the classes which have large number of dataset. To compensate this issue, I have checked accuracy using different sampling tecchniques and models to judge weather it gives any differnece or not.

***Here is the balanced accuarcy, precision and recall of all models.
1. Logistic Regression and Random Over Sampling
Balanced Accuracy : 1.0
Precision : 1.0
Recall : 1.0

2. Logistic Regression and SMOTE Over Sampling
Balanced Accuracy : 1.0
Precision : 1.0
Recall : 1.0

3. Logistic Regression and Cluster Centroids (Under Sampling)
Balanced Accuracy : 1.0
Precision : 1.0
Recall : 1.0

4. Logistic Regression and SMOTEENN (Under Sampling)
Balanced Accuracy : 1.0
Precision : 1.0
Recall : 1.0

5. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
Balanced Accuracy : 1.0
Precision : 1.0
Recall : 1.0

6. Easy Ensemble Classifier
Balanced Accuracy : 1.0
Precision : 1.0
Recall : 1.0

***All models are giving same acuuracy, preciosn and recall. It is all 1.0. It means definetly models are overfitting.
So, i can not recommed any model because of the above reason.
